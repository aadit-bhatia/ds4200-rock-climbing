            Over the past two years, rock climbing has become an integral part of my lifestyle. I've explored various climbing styles, including outdoor bouldering, gym, and  top-rope. Each style offers unique challenges and rewards. Bouldering has honed my problem-solving skills, focusing intensely on short, powerful routes. Top-rope climbing provided a safe environment for improving endurance and technique. Outdoors climbing, however, has been the most rewarding, offering a sense of freedom and community with my friends, who work to support and encourage each other to better themselves. In the photo above is my friend Paolo, who introduced me to rock climbing, attempting a chimney route in Hammond Pond Reservation in Brookline. This route was especially tough because you have to start with your back parallel to the ground, requiring a lot of core strength. Additionally, its hard to avoid the rock outcroppings if you lose strength and fall, meanining we had to be dilligent in spotting him and make sure that the pads were adequately shifted. None of us managed the route that day, but the problem solving journey and physical challenge made every move a learning experience that I enjoyed greatly. I hope to revisit the reservation soon and give this climb another shot.
